      <h2> The Budget </h2>
      <p> A budget is a way of seeing where all your money is coming from and where it is going.  This is very important
      if you want to know why you don't have the money to buy the things that you want.  By categorizing your transactions
      you can group together similar transactions and get a better idea of what you are spending your money on over longer
      periods of time.  You can then use this information to make informed decisions about how you intend to spend
      your money in the future </p>
      <p> Goals are a way of establishing an amount of money you want to save and tracking your progress towards meeting that goal.
      Goals can be both short term (meaning you expect to reach your goal in weeks) or long term (meaning something you are saving
      for months or years).
